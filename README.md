Predicting Hospital Readmission in Diabetic PatientsA Machine Learning Study on Large-Scale Clinical DataAbstractHospital readmissions represent a critical challenge for healthcare systems, reflecting both patient outcomes and economic burden. This project investigates the prediction of readmission for diabetic patients using a large real-world clinical dataset spanning multiple hospitals and years. The work focuses on constructing a rigorous end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline capable of handling noisy, heterogeneous medical data.Problem StatementGiven patient records collected during hospital stays, the objective is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted after discharge.The original dataset defines three outcomes:No readmissionReadmission within 30 daysReadmission after 30 daysDue to severe class imbalance and the clinical utility of identifying any return to care, the problem is reformulated as a binary classification task:$$y = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if readmitted} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$Dataset OverviewSource: Health Facts Database (Cerner Corporation)Time Span: 1999–2008Scope: ~130 U.S. hospital institutionsPopulation: Patients diagnosed with diabetesFeatures: Demographics, diagnoses (ICD-9), procedures, medications, and admission/discharge metadata.Clinical Data Characteristics:Extensive missingness (stochastic and systematic).High-cardinality categorical variables (e.g., thousands of diagnostic codes).Administrative coding artifacts and measurement inconsistencies.Methodology1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Distribution analysis of demographic variables.Examination of outcome imbalance ($y=1$ vs $y=0$).Identification of missingness patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).Statistical association tests (e.g., Chi-squared for categorical features).2. Data Preprocessing & CleaningFiltering: Removal of variables with $>40\%$ missing data.Deduplication: Elimination of constant or non-informative features.Standardization: Normalizing categorical labels and handling invalid entries.3. Feature EngineeringNumerical Transformation: Conversion of age ranges to numerical midpoints.Dimensionality Reduction: Aggregation of ICD-9 diagnosis codes into broader clinical groups (e.g., Circulatory, Digestive, Metabolic).Mapping: Re-categorizing admission and discharge IDs into meaningful clinical tiers (e.g., Emergency vs. Elective).4. Imputation StrategyStructured imputation for missing values.KNN-based Imputation for selected physiological variables.Explicit encoding of "Missing" as a unique category where clinically relevant.Implementation StackThe project is implemented in Python using the standard scientific computing ecosystem:NumPy – Linear algebra and numerical operations.Pandas – High-performance data manipulation.Matplotlib / Seaborn – Statistical data visualization.Scikit-learn – Preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.Key ChallengesClass Imbalance: Significant disparity between readmitted and non-readmitted classes.Sparsity: High-dimensional feature spaces resulting from One-Hot Encoding of medical codes.Confounding Variables: Distinguishing between clinical necessity and administrative bias.
